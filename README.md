# Enhanced_Kinklist

Try it out at https://kinkli.st

A very extensive and enhanced Kinktest based on https://github.com/Goctionni 's Kinklist. It aims to include much more kinks into the mix, as well as expanding possible answers.
Questions you've answered are kept in localStorage, so you can come back to the test later and your results will still be there, without them being saved on any server.
Only when you submit the results they get send to the server, and you are refered to the results page, outlining your choices. With a button in the middle you can copy a short link to your results to share with people to let them know what you're into.
Please be aware that the white answering choice "Not applicable/entered" is technically the same as not having entered anything at all, which is why fields answered with white will return to "unset" on page reload.


##### Planned Features

- Shorter Version, more versions in general
- Stats, comparing your anwsers to how others have answered
- GUI Support for comparison; it's already implemented, you can compare two results with https://kinkli.st/compare?a=\<Token A\>&b=\<Token B\>
